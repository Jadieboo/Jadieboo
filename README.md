- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jade-Sale
- 👀 I’m interested in books, music, games and of course the obvious, coding! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I'm new to coding, I have just finished learning the basics of HTML & CSS. I want to explore javascript next and also dive into some more advanced CSS. I'm a huge visual person and so far CSS really excites me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on websites, mobile apps and games. 
- 📫 If you want to reach out to me you can shoot me a DM over on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Jadie_Boo" title="Jade Sale's Twitter"> @Jadie_Boo </a>I will add other forms of contact at a later date.
